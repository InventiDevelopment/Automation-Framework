====== Soft-Assert Collector

`SoftAssertCollector` class instance collects and holds all the failed soft assertions, so that they can be reported later, when the test ends.

The `SoftAssertCollector` class instance is bound to the `TestRun` instance, that stands for the current test run and can be accessed from there by `getSoftAssertCollector()` method call.
