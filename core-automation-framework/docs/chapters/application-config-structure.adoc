====== Application Configuration File Structure

Now let's get on to the creation of the file. The required structure of the file differs according to the application platform. Create a `appConfig.yml` file in the configuration folder mentioned above with following structure:

.appConfig.yml file structure
[source,yaml]
----
application:
  <application type>:
    environments:
      <environment name>: "<value/url>"
----

The application name should correspond to the name defined for the application resources folder.
