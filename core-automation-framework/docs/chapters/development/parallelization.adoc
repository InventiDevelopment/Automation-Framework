= Test Execution Parallelization

You can run tests in parallel by using the standard TestNG attributes. *Please mind that the framework is currently optimized only for running on the TestNG's "classes" level*.

== How to Set up Parallel Test Execution

In your test suite XML file, you should add a `parallel="classes"` attribute to the `<suite>` tag. Moving onto the `<tests>` tag, please add a `thread-count=` attribute with a number of defined test classes (`<test>`) under this tag. Now when the test suite is run, defined test classes will be run in parallel.

If the `thread-count` attribute is set up incorrectly, it can lead to an unexpected behaviour of the automation framework.
