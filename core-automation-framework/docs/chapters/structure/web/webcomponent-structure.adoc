= WebComponent

`WebComponent` stands for an element that can be more complex, like a table, menu, sidebar, etc. It can not only contain another `WebComponent`, but also a `WebElement`. It provides you  with possibilities of adding additional functions and methods to work with these objects.

.Sample of WebComponent declaration in a WebPage class
[source,java]
```
SidePanel<T> sidePanel;
```

.Sample of WebComponent class implementation

    WebElement<SidePanel<T>> panelTitle;

    public SidePanel(WOProps props) {
        super(props);
    }
}
