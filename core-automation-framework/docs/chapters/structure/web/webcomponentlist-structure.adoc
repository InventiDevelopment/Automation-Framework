= WebComponentList

The `WebComponentList` is simply a list of `WebComponent` instances. You can work with it in a similar way, as you work with a list of `WebElement` - if there are more objects of `WebComponent` on the page, you can use `WebComponentList` to locate them all and work individually with any of them.

The elements of the list are located by XPath defined in `WebComponent`.

.Sample use of WebComponentList
[source,java]
```
WebComponentList<SideInfo<T>> sideInfos; // WebComponentList of ArticlePanels
```

.Sample of WebComponentList declaration in a WebComponent class
[source,java]
```
@FindElement(xpath = "//aside")
public class SidePanel<T extends WebObject> extends WebComponent<T> {
    WebComponentList<SideInfo<T>> sideInfos; // Declaration of WebComponentList

    @FindElement(xpath = "/h2")
    WebElement<SidePanel<T>> panelTitle;

    public SidePanel(WOProps props) {
        super(props);
        // Initialization with class of type SideInfo passing props along the way
        sideInfos = new WebComponentList<>(SideInfo.class, props);
    }
}
```

== Initializing WebComponentList

`WebComponentList` has to be initialized solely in a similar way to Java's ArrayList (mind the comment in the example above).
