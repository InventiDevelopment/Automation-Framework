= Application Configuration File Structure

Now let's get on to the creation of the file. The required structure of the file differs according to the application platform. Create a `appConfig.yml` file in the configuration folder mentioned above with following structure:

.appConfig.yml file structure
[source,yaml]
```
application:
  <application type>:
    <application name>:
      environments:
        <environment name>: "<value/url>"
```

The application name should correspond to the name defined for the application resources folder.

.appConfig.yml file structure for web application
[source,yaml]
```
application:
  web:
    sampleapplication:
      environments:
        PROD: "https://sampleapplication.com"
```

.appConfig.yml file structure for API application
[source,yaml]
```
application:
  api:
    sampleapplication:
      environments:
        PROD: "https://sampleapplication.com"
      relaxedHttpsValidation: true
```
