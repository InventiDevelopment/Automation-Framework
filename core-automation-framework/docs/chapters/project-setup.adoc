=== Setting-up a Project

To start creating automated tests for your application, only two steps are necessary:

. xref:#_1_create_a_maven_module_for_your_application[Create a Maven Module for Your Application]
. xref:#_2_create_application_related_configuration_files[Create Application Configuration Files]

[#_1_create_a_maven_module_for_your_application]
==== 1. Create a Maven Module for Your Application

Create a new Maven module in your favourite IDE - adjust the package naming to your needs.Recommended name of the module is in a lower-case format with dash instead of spaces - *this name will be used later in the code and in folder names for application resources!*

Child module should contain a Maven POM configuration file that will be linked to the `core-automation-framework` module and have a parent project defined.

        <groupId>cz.inventi.qa</groupId> <!-- Define group ID if changed. -->
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version> <!-- Don't forget to change the version if necessary. -->
    </parent>

        <!-- Linking the automation framework. -->

            <groupId>cz.inventi.qa</groupId>
            <artifactId>core-automation-framework</artifactId>

Depending on your needs, it is recommended to create Java packages according to your group ID that was defined in the root project POM and is then derived in the children's POMs.For the POM file specified above, the structure of the child module could look like this:

[#_2_create_application_related_configuration_files]
==== 2. Create Application-related Configuration Files

Typically, applications under the test can have their own specifics, like a URL (for cloud applications with backend and frontend implementations), paths to executables (desktop applications) or APK files (Android mobile application).These platform-dependent specifics can be defined in configuration files that are mandatory to be provided at the input to the framework.

All the configuration files should be saved in the application resources folder: `<your module name>/src/java/main/resources/<your application name>/config`.

image::application-resources-structure.jpg[Maven module resources structure example,350,role=text-center]

===== Application Configuration File

Such specifics can be saved in framework configuration files. By default, framework requires at least one main configuration file - the application settings file `appConfig.yml`.

If you want to supply your custom YAML configuration file or want to just simply rename the file, you can supply it as an input parameter:

.Using command line
[source,]
[source]
----
... -DappConfig=myOwnAppConfig.yml ---
----

.Using TestNG suite
[source,xml]
[source]
----
...
    <parameter name="appConfig" value="myOwnAppConfig.yml"/>
...
----

Note that this file should be located as well inside the application's resources folder.

Now let's get on to the creation of the file.The required structure of the file differs according to the application platform.Create a `appConfig.yml` file in the configuration folder mentioned above.

[#_webdriver_configuration_file]
===== WebDriver Configuration File

If you plan to test front-end of a web application, you need to define also a WebDriver configuration file along with the application config file.This file goes to the same folder and it's default name is `webDriverConfig.yml`.

*Currently, only the ChromeDriver implementation is supported, however an extension for other browsers can be easily provided using the WebDriverManager.*

include::webdriver-config-structure.adoc[]

Similarly to the application config file, if you want to supply your custom YAML configuration file or want to just simply rename the file, you can supply it as an input parameter:

.Using command line
[source,bash]
----
... -DwebDriverConfig=myOwnWebDriverConfig.yml ---
----

.Using TestNG suite
[source,xml]
----
...
<parameter name="webDriverConfig" value="myOwnWebDriverConfig.yml"/>
...
----

That's it, now you can start xref:#_test_development[developing your first test]!
